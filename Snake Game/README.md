# Python-Projects

This is my first python project. I have created a Snake Game. 

This project has 4 python files. 

1. food.py - it contains the code related to the food. How it is going to display on the screen and consumed by the snake.
2. scoreboard.py - it contains all the code regarding the socre tracking and display the "GAME OVER"
3. snake.py - This file contains all the information about the snake body how it will be generated and how it will be extended when it consumes the food.
4. main.py - Atlast the main file. it has all the information about the game. How it is running and how it is using the OOPs concept to call the funtions from different files.
